# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:
            # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v4

            # 2. This action installs the pnpm package manager and makes the `pnpm` command available.
            # This MUST come before setting up Node.js caching.
            - name: Setup pnpm
              uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
              with:
                  version: 8 # You can specify a pnpm version, like 8 or 'latest'

            # 3. Sets up a Node.js environment and configures caching for pnpm.
            # This will dramatically speed up dependency installation on subsequent runs.

              uses: actions/setup-node@v4

            # 4. Install dependencies using the lockfile for reproducibility.
            # This step will be very fast if the cache from the previous step is hit.
